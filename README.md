# Flip Book - A sentence reversing program in Ruby

By [Matthew Yang](http://www.matthewgyang.com).

## Description
**This program was created as a code challenge assignment to take a sentence where the word order has been reversed and put it back together correctly. **HOWEVER** the use of the `String#split` method is not allowed.

Example input: `"test. a is This"`

Example output: `"This is a test."`

`flip_book` defines a class with one method.  There are currently passing tests as well.

This is not the best solution, after seeing some other solutions I definitely think I could refactor, however I want to leave this as my initial attempt.
